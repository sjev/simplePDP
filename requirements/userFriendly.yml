# user friendly decomposition
req : tool **must** be user-friendly and support "traditional" way of writing requrements.

decomposition : |
    The easiest way of writing is just plain text. It provides the freedom of writing in users favorite editor,
    and enables to focus on the process and the contents, rather than the tooling.
    There are different options for text-based light-weight markup that already exist.
    One of the most popular ones are
    
    * markdown (and its flavors)
    * reStructuredText
    
    for an overview of their synthax, see [here](http://hyperpolyglot.org/lightweight-markup)
    
    Because we need to cross-reference and tag requirements, the system also needs some kind of directive.
    Being able to add commnents is a welcome feature.
    
    The system must support requirements growing into thousands, therefore splitting the system
    into multiple files is essential.
    
requirements:
  
  R008a:
    req: tool **must** use plain text input

  R008b:
    req: tool **must** enable cross referencing and structuring the requirements

  R008c:
    req: tool **should** support comments
  
  R008d:
