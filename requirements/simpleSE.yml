# ---------------
#
# decomposition is a tree starting from a single requirement and decomposing them into
# multiple requirements, until a requirement can be tranformed into design choice
# 
#  Workflow
# ----------
#  * start from the root requirement and decompose further, example below.
#    supported objects
#     - requrements = a list with separate requirements  
#     - decomposition = rationale on how to split to multiple requirements
#  * separate decomposition trees are separated by `---` separators
#  * extra files can be included with
