# 
# How it works
# ---------------
#
# decomposition is a tree starting from a single requirement and decomposing them into
# multiple requirements, until a requirement can be tranformed into design choice
# 
#  Workflow
# ----------
#  * start from the root requirement and decompose further, example below.
#    supported objects
#     - requrements = a list with separate requirements  
#     - decomposition = rationale on how to split to multiple requirements
#  * separate decomposition trees are separated by `---` separators
#  * extra files can be included with

  A user (architect or designer) needs to manage requirements of a complex system.
  A good requirement management system requires
  
requirements:
  
  - text: **must** support requirement workflow
  - text: **must** have traceability
  - text: **must** have version control
  - text: **must** support multiple users
  - text:  **must** be user-friendly and support 'traditional' way of writing requrements.
    decomposition: !include userFriendly.yml
