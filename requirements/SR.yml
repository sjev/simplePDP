1: 
    req : I **want** requirements to be documented in a consistent, structural way.
    rationale : |
      A user (architect or designer) **needs** to manage requirements of a complex system.
      A good requirement management system has a set of high-level requirements  


2: 
    req: I **want** to track requirement history and create baselines

3:
    req: | 
      I **want** to spend as little time as possible on mechanical tasks, like
      formatting documents.
      
      
      

4:
    req: I **want**  to know when all requirement dependencies are satisfied.
    rationale: Quick overview for requirement dependancy.


5: 
    req: I **want** each requirement to be traceable

6: 
    req: I **want** an overview that shows ho high-level requirements match final low-level solutions


7:
    req: I **want** each requirement to have a clear status, from 'draft' to 'satisfied'
    rationale : | 
          requirements are defined and changed during development process.
          Usually a requirement goes through different stages from draft to 'validated' or 'satisfied'


8:
    req: I **want** the tool to check for requirment consistency
    requirements:
      R004a:
        req : tool **must** check identifiers for consistency
        rationale : "because identifiers are entered by hand, there is a chance of duplicate entries. these are not allowed"
        related: R008d

9:
    req: I **want** to easliy cooperate with others on writing requirement documents
    requirements:
      R007:
        req: tool **must** support multiple users
        solution: S003

10:
    req: I **want** to produce graphic charts visualizing requirement dependancy
    requirements :
      R011: 
        req: tool **must** print requirements in a tree structure
        solution: S005
