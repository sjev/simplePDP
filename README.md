# simpleSE
Requirements management tool assisting Systems Engineering process. Provides a framework for doing requirements decomposition in a structured way.

*this project documents its own requirements decomposition and design choices, how cool is that!*

## Why simpleSE?
* because designing complex systems requires structured approach
* because the process decomposing requirements is more important than the tools used
* because architects and designers can do a better job with a good tool
* because tools should be as simple as possible, but not any simpler


## Alternatives

* commercial requirement management packages ($$$), there are [a lot of them](http://makingofsoftware.com/resources/list-of-rm-tools)
* open-source text-based requirement managers, see [rmtoo](https://github.com/florath/rmtoo) and [doorstop](https://github.com/jacebrowning/doorstop)
